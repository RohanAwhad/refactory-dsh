/**
 * The graph profile's spine, mounted headless with a scripted person: the owner a
 * `refactory ceo` run gets, without the CEO model.
 *
 *   node graph-owner.mjs --script FILE -- <graph-startup arguments>
 *
 * The real `graph-startup` row parses the arguments `refactory ceo` passes to
 * `dsh --profile graph run` and publishes the run's graph, work directory, command
 * environment and bridges; the spine row is then mounted with the config
 * `packages/bundle/graph/cordis.patch.yml` gives it. So every node runs as on a real
 * run: commands and agent workers (`worker_node`) dispatched by the spine, a user gate
 * put to the person through the user-questions channel and recorded by the gate bridge.
 * What stands in for the CEO is the loop at the end, which only advances the cursor and
 * routes user gates, as a CEO following the spine's driving contract does.
 *
 * FILE holds `answers`: what the person answers at user gates, in the order the run
 * asks them, across every owner of the run. Each is a verdict, or `{ selected, custom }`
 * for a verdict with a note. A gate asked with no answer left cannot be asked here, as a
 * headless owner's cannot: the question is refused, the spine records the run `refused`
 * with the commands that answer it elsewhere, and the owner exits. Each question is
 * appended to `questions.log` beside FILE.
 *
 * Commands run asynchronously, as the shell service runs them, so a fork's branches are
 * dispatched at once and their workers write the run's facts concurrently.
