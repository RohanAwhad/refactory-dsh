"""One event vocabulary, two levels, and the same records behind both.

The failure this locks down: a run wrote ``progress.jsonl`` and printed nothing
until it finished, so a search that was working looked like a hang. The meaningful
level is what a watcher gets; the verbose level is everything, for a caller
debugging the search itself.
