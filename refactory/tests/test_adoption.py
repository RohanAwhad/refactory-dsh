"""Adopting a run's winner: the artifact D15 names and nothing built.

`create`, `edit` and `design` produce something new, and D15 says an **adopting
loop** does too. It did not exist, so a run's winner was unreachable: the report
carries a score, `state.json`'s population carries edits, `console candidate`
carries a diff, and none of them can be run. The state is in `journal.jsonl`, and
reading a journal by hand is not an interface.

These assert the two properties that matter and the one the decision is actually
about: the adopted mode scores what the winner scored, and adopting changes nothing
it read. The second is D15's whole point -- "so the baseline stays measurable" -- and
a test that only checked a file appeared would not notice it being violated.
