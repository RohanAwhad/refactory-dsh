Everything that places the run and lands its change is `repo_change`'s: the knobs that
say where it works, the facts its prepare op returns, and the materialise node. What is
the mode's own is its prompt, its check gate and its report. It opens no pull request: a
pull request is opened only behind an approval gate that names it (#350), so the fix stays
on the run's branch, which the report names.
