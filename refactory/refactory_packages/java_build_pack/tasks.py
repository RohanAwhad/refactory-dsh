"""The Java source trees this harness is pointed at, and what running one proves.

A Task is the harness's input port. `instances()` lists one directory per source tree, `setup` copies that tree into the run directory, `prompt` says what the item's agent is asked for, and `verify` runs the build script the pass wrote and compares what the program printed with the output recorded beside the sources.

An item directory has three parts, and they are what a person needs to add a tree of their own:

    <item>/src/**.java    the sources
    <item>/item.json      {"main_class": "...", "main_args": "..."}
    <item>/expected.txt   exactly what running the entry point prints

These three are the fixture the package ships. To run the harness on your own trees, point the run at them (`refactory run java_build_pack/build --source <dir>`): the items a harness reads are run configuration, so a Task does not need a second mechanism for it and the graph never carries them.
