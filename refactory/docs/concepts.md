# Concepts

Refactory makes an agentic workflow explicit, interactive and searchable. A mode can be small or elaborate: research and QA are graph choices, not requirements imposed on every harness.

## Packages, modes and Tasks

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Package** | A named collection of Python modes and their supporting operations |
| **Mode** | An explicit graph, declared knobs and input/output contracts; a scored mode also defines the objective used by optimization |
| **Task** | The source of work items, per-item preparation and verification used by a mode's data node |
| **CEO** | The conversational coordinator that drives the graph and delegates its agent nodes |
| **Outer loop** | A search that proposes, validates and measures permitted changes to a mode |

Shipped packages live in `refactory/refactory_packages/`. Created, imported and adopted packages live in the project's `.factory/packages/`. Both use the same registry. A package may be disabled without deleting it.

Create produces a reusable package; Edit produces a revised package and records where it came from. Both stage their output in a per-run directory inside the run (`<run>/.factory-staging/.factory/packages/<name>/`), so two parallel runs of the same package name never collide; at registration the staged package is copied atomically to the shared `.factory/packages/<name>/` (write a sibling directory, rename the old aside, rename the new in, then delete the old), and the copy is refused — naming the other run — if the shared package's state differs from what prepare recorded, including when it now exists but did not before. A git worktree is not used because `.factory/` is gitignored: a worktree of the project contains no `.factory/packages/`, and nothing written there becomes a commit. The per-run staging directory isolates the run, and `prepare_create()` records both `source_hash` and `source_existed` so `register()` detects all conflicts. After a successful register, the origin stamp in `.origin.json` identifies the registering run so a reloop does not refuse itself. Design produces software: commits on its own branch, in a git worktree of the repository it changes or of a new project in `~/refactory-projects/` (a run with its worktree off writes `.factory/artifacts/` instead). A Design run whose reviews pass delivers that branch as a pull request, which its approval gate names first; design_fast, which has no approval gate, leaves it on the branch. When the build loop's limits are spent, a draft delivery can open a draft PR with unresolved findings listed in its description; the `draft_delivery` fact carries the reason and the unresolved items; nothing sets it until b40b. Any mode that changes a repository can take the same steps: see [if your mode changes a repository](tutorials/01-write-a-mode.md#if-your-mode-changes-a-repository). Create, create_fast, edit and edit_fast also isolate their writes; see the [mode classification table](#mode-classification-table) below. Create and Design are deliberately unscored authoring modes: successful completion is governed by their graph's checks, not a numeric search objective. Standalone Design artifacts are not optimizer candidates.

### Mode classification table

| Mode | Writes today | Isolation method |
|---|---|---|
| design | worktree at `~/.refactory/worktrees/` (via `repo_change.locate`) | git worktree |
| design_fast | worktree at `~/.refactory/worktrees/` (via `repo_change.locate`) | git worktree |
| create | `.factory/packages/<name>/` via per-run staging, then copy-on-register | staging directory |
| create_fast | `.factory/packages/<name>/` via per-run staging, then copy-on-register | staging directory |
| edit | `.factory/packages/<name>/` via per-run staging, then copy-on-register | staging directory |
| edit_fast | `.factory/packages/<name>/` via per-run staging, then copy-on-register | staging directory |
| loop | `.factory/loop/<run-id>/` (run directory only) | none needed |
| optimize | `.factory/loop/<run-id>/` (run directory only) | none needed |

## What a graph contains

| Node | Work |
|---|---|
| `op` | Invoke a Python operation |
| `agent` | Delegate a tool-using agent task; it can involve multiple model turns |
| `gate` | Route on a deterministic, agent or user verdict |
| `fork` / `join` | Dispatch independent branches and wait for their results |
| `data` | Run a subgraph over a Task's items |

Nodes declare inputs, outputs and facts. Runtime validation catches structural violations; the mode's own checks establish its application requirements. Neither a file's existence nor an agent's statement proves its content correct.

A user gate is an explicit control point. The runtime asks the person or uses their deliberately configured authorization; the coordinator cannot invent approval.

## Graph execution and interactivity

The CLI and GUI present the same underlying workflows. The CEO uses workflow tools to open a graph, see the due node, dispatch workers and record completion. The runtime owns the cursor and the gates. Its guard disables the CEO's direct coding and skill tools during graph execution.

Workers may use skills as supporting instructions. The graph's structure and durable run state remain the execution mechanism. A graph does not depend on an agent remembering a checklist in a skill document.

Steering notes are recorded and supplied to subsequent work. Explicit prompt edits and reruns change a selected node's execution. Notes do not automatically rewrite deterministic operations, and delivery does not prove semantic compliance. See [Terminal and GUI](interfaces.md) for the current timing and UI boundaries.

## State, knobs and protected requirements

A Python mode declares its initial graph with `build()`. After that, `state_dict()` contains the graph and knobs as serializable data. The optimizer edits this state; it does not rewrite `build()` or arbitrary source files.

Knobs are declared inputs and parameters with types, bounds and mutability. Use them to pass actual values into deterministic operations. An intent such as “count to twenty” is context; `target=20` supplies the input.

A scored mode's `score()` and `invariants()` are methods outside the editable state. The validator enforces those declared boundaries before evaluating proposals. Required artifacts that are not part of a numeric score need meaningful invariants and acceptance checks; a higher score alone does not establish that every user requirement survived.

## The configurable outer loop

Three choices are independent:

| Choice | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Strategy / outer loop** | Organize selection, proposal rounds and stopping |
| **Optimizer** | Propose candidate edits |
| **Evaluator** | Execute a candidate and measure its result |

The default walker evaluates the graph in Python and supplies a model client to agent nodes. The DSH evaluator lowers the graph and runs it through the shipping DSH runtime. Both carry the run's selected model/worker context to agent nodes; see [Models](models.md#model-selection-across-execution-paths).

Permitted edits can include knobs, prompts, nodes and edges, subject to the selected preset and invariants. A proposal is validated before it can spend candidate evaluation budget. Execution failures are recorded but cannot win.

For Task-bound modes, candidates use the training partition and the winner is audited on held-out items. A mode without a data split reports holdout as not applicable. The compared score can include a graph-size penalty; the raw score is retained separately.

A [profile](optimization-profiles.md) versions the search settings and objective; each run retains its own resolved snapshot. Opt-in repeats report actual trial count and variability, while shared budgets account for proposals, evaluations and validation. Adoption writes the exact eligible winner into a new package with its profile and audit provenance. It does not alter the source package or guarantee a future stochastic run will reproduce the same outputs. No-improvement searches are valid outcomes.

## Models, agents and runtimes

Cordis supplies plugin composition and service lifecycle. DSH supplies the current agent runtime, tools, sessions and model-provider adapters. Refactory supplies modes, graph execution/steering and the meta outer loop.

The model provider and coding-agent runtime are different choices. Today, choosing an OpenAI model still runs the DSH coding agent. Optional Codex and Claude Code workers require an explicit backend selection and their native setup; they are not enabled by a model-name change. [Worker capabilities](models.md#model-provider-versus-coding-agent) define the supported controls.

## What evidence means

Keep three questions separate:

1. Did the framework execute the declared graph and handle gates, steering, failure and cleanup correctly?
2. Did the artifact meet its declared acceptance checks?
3. How good was the model's output across the workload, and at what cost?

A checker can be too narrow, a valid workflow can generate a poor answer, and a model timeout can leave a correctly reported failed run. Preserve the exact result and use the appropriate measurements for each question.
