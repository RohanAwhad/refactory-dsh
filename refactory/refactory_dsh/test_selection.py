"""Which tests design mode's self-check runs for an emission, in the order it runs them (b41a).

The engine reads the repository's own imports; it names no test or file of any
repository. Classified as a *product* module in ``data/boundary.json``, and no core
module imports it.

The selection, in order:

- **On a fix-up, the tests the last self-check found failing**, as ids.
- **Engine tests**, only when the emission changed a hub. A *hub* is a source module at
  least a quarter of the repository's Python test files import (`HUB_SHARE`): the
  engine or graph modules most of the suite is built on. The engine tests are the
  structural tests (test files that import no module of the repository: they read it
  as files, its layout, records and docs, so no import says a change cannot reach them)
  and the tests that import every hub, the ones built on the whole engine.
- **The test files the emission touched.**
- **The last check's failures** that are not inherited (dm-128's set), as test ids.
- **The tests that import a module the emission changed**, depth 1, and, when a source
  file changed but no hub did, the structural tests: cheapest first, so a slow file at
  the time limit does not hide cheap ones behind it (`estimated_costs`). A file a chunk
  was stopped with at the limit runs in a chunk of its own until one finishes it
  (`run_alone`); until then its time is a lower bound, which never lowers its estimate.

For a TypeScript runner only the spec files the emission touched are selected: the
check's own vitest invocation (``vitest run``) has no related-file selection, and
``--related`` there is an unknown option. A docs-only emission selects nothing.
