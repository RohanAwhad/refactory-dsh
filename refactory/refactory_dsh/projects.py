"""The projects design runs work on, and where to find them again.

A design run works on a **target**: an existing git repository, or a new project
refactory creates for it. New projects live in one discoverable folder
(:func:`projects_dir`, `~/refactory-projects` by default) rather
than under a checkout's git-ignored `.factory/`, and every target a run worked on is
listed in a registry beside refactory's other per-user state, with the run's branch
and how it ended. `refactory projects` reads it; `refactory projects prune` removes
what ended runs no longer need (:func:`refactory_dsh.worktree.prune`).

Ported from remote-factory's `~/factory-projects` and `factory/registry.py`. The
registry is written under a file lock as well as atomically, because two runs can end
at the same moment.
